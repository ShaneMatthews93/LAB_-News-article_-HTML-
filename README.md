# Rattlesnake News Article Webpage

This project is a lab assignment for creating a webpage based on a news article about rattlesnakes and their babies. The goal is to practice HTML markup and include various elements as specified in the lab instructions.

## Purpose

- Develop skills in HTML markup and webpage creation.
- Understand how to structure and organize content within an HTML document.
- Practice including different types of elements such as images, headings, paragraphs, and lists.

## Instructions

To run the webpage locally on your machine:

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**
   
   git clone https://github.com/ShaneMatthews93/LAB_-News-article_-HTML-
  

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

## Version Control with Git

This project also provides an opportunity to practice version control with Git. Git is a powerful tool used for tracking changes in files, collaborating with others, and managing project history.

### Basic Git Commands

- `git status`: Check the status of your working directory and staging area.
- `git add <file>`: Add changes in a file to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commit changes in the staging area to the repository with a descriptive message.
- `git push origin <branch>`: Push commits from your local repository to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
- `git pull origin <branch>`: Fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into your local branch.
- `git branch`: List all branches in the repository.
- `git checkout <branch>`: Switch to a different branch.

### Branching Workflow

- **Main Branch**: The main branch typically represents the stable version of the project.
- **Feature Branches**: Create feature branches to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main branch.
- **Merge Requests/Pull Requests**: After completing your work in a feature branch, create a merge request (or pull request) to merge your changes into the main branch.
